File:

When testing locally, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for
package information.

  $ snyk test --file=package.json

When ommitted Snyk will try to detect the appropriate file for your project by
looking for a `package.json` or `Gemfile` file.

If both files exist it will use the package.json file. In this case you can
force a Ruby test by pointing to your Gemfile.

  $ snyk test --file=Gemfile
