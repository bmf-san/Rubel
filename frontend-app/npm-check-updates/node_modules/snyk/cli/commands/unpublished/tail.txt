The flagged packages have been unpublished from npm.
An unpublished package can be republished by anyone, not
just the original author, including a malicious entity.

Please inspect those packages to ensure they include the
content you expected.

As the test is currently limited to packages unpublished
by Azer, you can also compare their content to the
repositories on Azer's GitHub account:
